# simple

The aim of this is to create an interpretor for a as-natural-as-possible language, called Simple for now (I'm really not talented in the art of giving names)

You are free to use this as an educative tool, an entertainement tool, or even a make fun of tool...
It's still in developpment (it's almost not even started yet so...) But if you have any suggestion, let it go
